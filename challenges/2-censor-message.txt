Write a function that, given a full message and a list of words, returns a single string that represents a 'censored' version of the original message: all words from the list must be scrubbed out and replaced with five asterisks (*****).

The censor must scrub out matches that are case insensitive.

You may assume that each string in the list is a lowercase single word.
You may assume that there is no punctuation apart from spaces in the full message.

function:
=========
name: censorMessage

parameters:
  - MESSAGE: string
  - BAN_LIST: list of strings

return type: string

pseudo code:
============
set RAW_WORDS to the list of strings created by separating the string message into sub-strings at every space (' ')

set SCRUBBED_WORDS to an empty list

for each string, WORD, in RAW_WORDS
	set LOWERCASE_WORD to lowercase(word)
  if LOWERCASE_WORD is contained in the list BAN_LIST
    insert the string '*****' at the end of SCRUBBED_WORDS
  else
    insert WORD at the end of SCRUBBED_WORDS

set SCRUBBED_MESSAGE to the string created by joining together every string in SCRUBBED_WORDS with a space (' ') as a join character

return SCRUBBED_MESSAGE

test cases:
===========
censorMessage("don't mess with cats", ["mess"]) should be "don't ***** with cats"
censorMessage("Are you sure that this is safe", ["are", "is"]) should be "***** you sure that this ***** safe"
censorMessage("I CANNOT HELP YOU", ["can", "not", "help", "you"]) should be "I CANNOT ***** *****"
